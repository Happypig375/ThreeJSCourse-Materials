# Course syllabus

Welcome to MULS2361!!

## Course Aim:

The programme aims to:

- enable students to learn virtual reality programming in a fun and beginner friendly environment;
- introduce students the fundamental mathematical concepts in 3D computer graphics;
- strengthen studentsâ€™ logical thinking on programming and mathematical concepts
- apply the programming and computer graphics knowledge via developing a Virtual Reality (VR) application; and
- encourage participants to be more creative and challenge themselves through designing and developing VR application.
